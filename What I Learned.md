## Module 1
#### Module 1, looking back, seems like quite the whirlwind. I think I understood about 20% of the words during lecture, and had an incorrect understanding of most of the new vocabulary. I'm still getting a hold on this. I will say, learning the origins of coding and how they fit with the computer vs. the science aspect of what we're dealing with was fascinating. 
#### During this module, I got a better understanding of the theory of statistics. Previously, I only had application-centered knowledge. I knew how to run a t-test or an anova, look at the p value, and move on with my life. Now, words like "variance" and "correlation" have more of a scientific meaning for me rather than a lay-people meaning, and I can determine how to find them mathematically. 
#### This module (and especially the next one) taught me that python is very finicky in how data is uploaded and processed. The honest to god hardest part of this entire course for me was the first step: GETTING DATA TO LOAD IN A NOTEBOOK. I used a csv file for the first experimental "basic stats" notebook, as I was most familiar with this form and knew how to manipulate the columns for scatter plots intuitively. 

## Module 2
#### I had never heard of FFT in my life, so this was a brand new concept for me. I have basic music theory, so I was able to utilize this knowledge to solidify my understanding of the vocabulary in this module. I was a biology major in undergrad, so learning about climate dynamics is a complete 180 for me. After a year of courses, I have a great appreciation for natural variability and oscillating patterns in nature, so being able to utilize the theory of that knowledge and see within the notebooks how to parse out those signals was rewarding, albeit I had minimal success being able to accomplish this with very complex data. I'm still figuring out NetCDF files, but I did find a few good youtube videos to help me out. This one (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CZyNwBa9c&list=PLJgifxKntXEiYzdxS7xgLO8m6CiQXWuzA) helped make it click. 
#### As I mentioned in my presentation of learning pt. 1 presentation, removing/smoothing data made me nervous in that I felt like I was manipulating data for my own gain/to show the result I wanted. It wasn't until module 3 where I really understood the scientific reason behind doing so rather than the data compression reason like we learned with the fingerprint compression lesson/the photo notebooks.
