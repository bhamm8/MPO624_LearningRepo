## Module 1
#### Module 1, looking back, seems like quite the whirlwind. I think I understood about 20% of the words during lecture, and had an incorrect understanding of most of the new vocabulary. I'm still getting a hold on this. I will say, learning the origins of coding and how they fit with the computer vs. the science aspect of what we're dealing with was fascinating. 
#### During this module, I got a better understanding of the theory of statistics. Previously, I only had application-centered knowledge. I knew how to run a t-test or an anova, look at the p value, and move on with my life. Now, words like "variance" and "correlation" have more of a scientific meaning for me rather than a lay-people meaning, and I can determine how to find them mathematically.
